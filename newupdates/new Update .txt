Fix the Intro.MP4 video settings:
- On mobile, the video looks correct, but the Skip button has shifted down. The Skip button must always stay fixed and visible in the bottom-right corner on mobile.  
- On desktop, the video appears distorted. The intro video should be fullscreen, sharp, and properly aligned on desktop.  
- The TTS button is still broken. Make the TTS button the same color, size, and alignment as all the other menu buttons.  

Do not break one thing while fixing another. All elements must work together consistently and without issues.
