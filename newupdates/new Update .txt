1- Adjust the intro.MP4 video so that it does not appear oversized in the application. 
On desktop (PC), keep the video in a square format to maintain the visual quality. 
On mobile devices, display the video in vertical (portrait) format. 
The "Skip" button must always remain visible in the bottom-right corner on both desktop and mobile. 
Currently, the Skip button is not visible on mobile — fix this so it appears properly.

2- Change all texts in the password input field to English. 
Any text currently displayed in Turkish should be replaced with English. 
For example, instead of "Şifre giriniz" it should say "Enter your password".

3- After logging in from the password screen, the main menu does not switch to Turkish when the TR option is selected. 
Fix this so that when TR is selected, all menu items, headings, and buttons are displayed fully in Turkish.

4- The TTS button in the main menu looks different from the other buttons. 
Make it the same color, size, and alignment as all the other buttons. 
All buttons must be equal, consistent, and properly aligned.
