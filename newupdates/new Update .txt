Make the intro.MP4 video fully responsive across devices. 
On desktop (PC), the video must appear in a square format, centered, aligned properly, and visually sharp. 
On mobile devices (especially Samsung Android phones), the video must display correctly in vertical (portrait) format. 
The same video file will be used for both; adjustments should be done only via CSS/HTML.
